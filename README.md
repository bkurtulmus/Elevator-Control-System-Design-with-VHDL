# Elevator Control System Design with VHDL

This repository contains the VHDL code and associated files for the "Elevator Control System Design" project, developed as part of the Logic & Digital Design course (CS303) at Sabanci University.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design and implement a functional elevator control system using VHDL. The system simulates the basic operation of an elevator, including handling multiple floors, responding to button presses, and managing the movement of the elevator car.

## Project Structure

- **/src**: Contains all the VHDL source files used in the project.
- **/testbench**: Includes the testbench files used to verify the functionality of the elevator system.
- **/docs**: Contains documentation related to the project, including design diagrams and explanations of the system architecture.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bkurtulmus/Elevator-Control-System-Design-with-VHDL.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Elevator-Control-System-Design-with-VHDL
   ```
3. Use your preferred VHDL simulation software to open and simulate the project files.

## Usage

The system can be tested by running the provided testbenches, which simulate various scenarios such as calling the elevator from different floors and pressing multiple buttons simultaneously.
